# Keep lock files if you want reproducible builds, but if this is a workspace root without a package.json controlling them, they might be ignored. 
# However, usually lockfiles ARE committed. The previous gitignore didn't ignore them, which is correct. 
# I will NOT ignore lockfiles in the final file, just the dependencies.
# Re-listing node_modules to be sure.

# (Users often want to share vscode config, but ignore local user specific stuff. 
# The previous one ignored .vscode/ entirely. I will stick to ignoring .vscode/ to be safe/conservative, 
# or maybe allow settings. I'll stick to the previous pattern of ignoring .vscode/ generally unless requested otherwise, 
# but "proper" often implies sharing settings. 
# I'll simply ignore .vscode/ but comment that some might want to track it.)
