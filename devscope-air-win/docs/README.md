# DevScope Docs

Last updated: February 23, 2026

This docs tree is split into two zones:

- `docs/current/` for the current codebase and active architecture.
- `docs/legacy/` for historical implementation notes, reports, and phase artifacts that are still useful for reference.

## Start Here

1. `docs/current/README.md`
2. `docs/platform/README.md`

## Current Docs

- `docs/current/CURRENT_CODEBASE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/current/CURRENT_CAPABILITIES_MATRIX.md`
- `docs/current/ENGINEERING_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md`
- `docs/current/CHANGE_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`
- `docs/platform/BUILDING_ON_TOP_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/platform/CLI_ON_DEVSCOPE.md`
- `docs/platform/IDE_EXTENSION_ON_DEVSCOPE.md`
- `docs/platform/ALT_UI_CLIENTS_ON_DEVSCOPE.md`

## Legacy Docs

See `docs/legacy/README.md` for archived content by topic.

## Doc Policy

- New work should update `docs/current/*` and relevant `docs/platform/*` files.
- Do not add new active docs into `docs/legacy/*`.
- If a current doc becomes outdated but still informative, move it to `docs/legacy/*` and add a short note in `docs/legacy/README.md`.
