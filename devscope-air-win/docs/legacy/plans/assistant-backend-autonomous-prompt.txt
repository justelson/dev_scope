Your mission:
- Complete backend track from Phase 01 through Phase 12 autonomously.
- Do not stop between phases unless blocked.
- If a phase is already complete in docs/plans/assistant-backend-progress.md, skip it and continue.
- Log every phase step in:
  - docs/ai/dispatch/assistant_backend_log.csv
  - docs/plans/assistant-backend-progress.md

Hard constraints:
- Modify only backend allowlist files for the active phase.
- Do not touch frontend files.
- No tests/build/typecheck until final Phase 12 validation step.
- If blocked by scope, stop and record blocker with exact path and reason.

Finish condition:
- All backend phases marked complete.
- Final validation done in Phase 12.
- Final handoff report produced in required reporting-contract format.
