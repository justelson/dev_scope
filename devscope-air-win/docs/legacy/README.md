# Legacy Docs Archive

This directory contains older but still potentially useful documents that are no longer treated as the source of truth for the current codebase.

## Why These Were Archived

Most archived docs are one or more of:

- Completion reports tied to earlier milestones.
- Phase-board execution artifacts.
- Historical UI/terminal behavior that has since changed.
- Plan files superseded by current architecture docs.

## Archived Sections

- `docs/legacy/ai/`
- `docs/legacy/backend/`
- `docs/legacy/frontend/`
- `docs/legacy/git-features/`
- `docs/legacy/performance/`
- `docs/legacy/plans/`
- `docs/legacy/project-details-features/`
- `docs/legacy/refactor/`
- `docs/legacy/terminal/`
- `docs/legacy/testing/`
- `docs/legacy/ui/`

## Usage Guidance

- Use these docs for historical context, not as implementation instructions.
- Validate all behavior against current code before acting on any legacy recommendation.
- Prefer `docs/current/*` and `docs/platform/*` for active planning and implementation.
- Some archived docs still contain old path references like `docs/ai/...` or `docs/plans/...`; map them to `docs/legacy/ai/...` and `docs/legacy/plans/...`.
