Assignment: Frontend Phase 06 and Phase 07 only

Execution mode:
1. Complete Phase 06 fully.
2. Only after Phase 06 is 100% done, continue to Phase 07.
3. If a requirement already exists, verify it and mark it as SKIPPED (already implemented).

Hard scope rules:
- Do not modify any file outside the active phase allowlist.
- Do not do Phase 08+ work.
- Preserve current UI/UX/features unless the active phase explicitly requires change.
- No tests/builds unless phase policy explicitly allows it.

Phase 06 allowlist (frontend):
- src/renderer/src/pages/assistant/**
- src/renderer/src/pages/settings/AssistantSettings.tsx

Phase 06 objective:
- Events console with filters + search
- Formatted/raw payload toggle
- Copy/export/reset actions

Phase 07 allowlist (frontend):
- src/renderer/src/pages/Assistant.tsx
- src/renderer/src/pages/assistant/**
- src/renderer/src/lib/settings.tsx (only if persistence is required)

Phase 07 objective:
- Sessions/thread management UI
- New chat/new thread controls
- Rename/delete/archive session UX

Phase handoff requirements:
- At end of Phase 06:
  - Append CSV row to docs/ai/dispatch/assistant_frontend_log.csv
  - Write assistant_phase06_frontend_report.md
- At end of Phase 07:
  - Append CSV row to docs/ai/dispatch/assistant_frontend_log.csv
  - Write assistant_phase07_frontend_report.md
